## üåç English
Primelists is a collection of lists of domains, IP addresses, and phone numbers used to enhance security against ads, tracking, malware, and malicious actors.

This repository provides curated lists that can be used in solutions such as Pi-hole, firewalls (firewalld, iptables), intrusion detection systems, and other filtering environments.

## Contents
* **primelist_domains.txt**
Primary list of domains to block (ads, tracking, and malware).

* **primelist_domains_eval.txt**
List of domains under evaluation. These are tested on our public DNS servers before being promoted to the main list, reducing false positives.

* **primelist_ips.txt**
Primary list of IP addresses considered malicious actors, used to protect against brute force attacks and other network threats.

## How It Works
### Domains

* Initial base: StevenBlack/hosts.
* The list is extended based on our own identification and analysis.
* Domains pass through the evaluation list before joining the main list.

### IPs

* Collected from brute force attacks detected on our own and participant servers, mainly via Fail2Ban.
* IPs are published with a 90-day retention policy.
* The aim is to share threat intelligence to strengthen collective defense.

## How to Use

### Domain Blocking
Add the following lists to Pi-hole or other compatible blockers:

* Main list:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/source-saraiva/primelist/refs/heads/main/primelist_domains.txt
  ```
**Suggested comment:** `source-saraiva`

* Evaluation list:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/source-saraiva/primelist/refs/heads/main/primelist_domains_eval.txt
  ```
**Do not use in production**

### IP Blocking
To integrate the IPs into your firewall, you can create a script using curl or wget that runs via cron to update regularly:
```bash
# Example for firewalld
URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/source-saraiva/primelist/refs/heads/main/primelist_ips.txt"
curl -s $URL -o /tmp/primelist_ips.txt

# Apply to access-denied zone
for ip in $(cat /tmp/primelist_ips.txt); do
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=access-denied --add-source=$ip
done

sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
## Notes
* Use these lists with caution: overly aggressive lists may block legitimate traffic.
* Maintaining a whitelist for trusted IPs/domains is recommended.
* More user participation improves accuracy and reduces false positives.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute:
1. Submit issues with suggestions for new domains/IPs.
2. Share false positive reports to improve curation.
3. You can also propose pull requests with additional lists.
