Keep the internet clean!

**clean-internet** is an open-source initiative aimed at making the web safer, faster, and cleaner by leveraging community-maintained blocklists to filter out:

- Ads and trackers
- Malware domains
- Phishing and scam sites
- Cryptojacking scripts
- Other unwanted online threats

The goal is to provide a ready-to-use, regularly updated collection of blocklists that can be integrated with Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, DNS filtering solutions, and browser-based blockers.
