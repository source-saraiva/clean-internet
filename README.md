# Primelist

Primelist is a curated hosts list that contains domains associated with adware, malware, and other unwanted content that need to be blocked. By consolidating trusted sources and extending the list with newly discovered threats, Primelist helps protect your network privacy and security effectively.


## How It Works

- We collect hosts entries from multiple trusted sources.  
- The lists are intelligently merged and curated to remove redundancies and false positives.  
- We also actively discover and extend the list with new ad domains and other unwanted hosts to enhance coverage.


## Files

- `hosts_test_list.txt`  
  This is the testing list where new updates and changes undergo comprehensive testing and validation.

- `hosts_stable_list.txt`  
  Once thoroughly tested and vetted, the hosts entries are promoted to this stable list for public use.


## Contributing
We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve coverage and maintain quality. Please ensure any additions are well tested before submission.
